Blockchain House Uganda will be center for creating Blockchain and Komodo awareness, adoption, educational materials and other opportunities to the local communities of Uganda.
There are many emerging blockchain Use cases, however most of them are very complex to be Understood by local communities. 
We have come up with strategies that will help to break the complicity to simplicity i.e Blockchain House Uganda will have one Local use case,  BLOCKCHAIN shop that will be an Online shop accepting BTC, BLOCKCHAIN as a mode of payment.
The Blockchain house will primarily be used as;
•	Event space for educational courses and meetups
•	Workspace/dev hub to create our own dedicated tools
•	Happy pay remittance
•	The house itself will have fait exchange
•	Interniship space for Universitiy Students

GOALS

•	Spread BLOCKCHAIN awarness to local communities
•	Create BLOCKCHAIN adaption 
•	Create Job opportunities
•	Have a local development community to develop on BLOCKCHAIN
•	Have a community that Understands the Basics of Blockchain hence reduce on scam and Myths.

CHALLENGES
There are a lot of Myths about Blockchain space due to lack of sensitization, complex Use cases to be understood by Local community members.
More to that, It is no easy for a local member to easily use an exchange to convert Ug shillings to another Blockchain currency and vice versa, Moreover, having an account on a Blockchain exchange since most of them are centralized, they require KYC and in most cases the KYC is not easy to complete hence sometimes this is against privacy and security.
The current modes of payments for example Mobile money payment systems all over the country have high transaction fees, including the tax with was recently added on by the government.

SOLUTIONS
1.	The Blockchain House will  be used as a center of education/meetup hosting to sensitize the local people about blockchain technologies.
2.	Work space for developers where they will regularly meetup together to build on use cases that can be used by local members 
3.	The Blockchain House Uganda will launch with one of a local use case i.e Blockchain Shop where clients can shop online and pay for their products, paid in cryptos
4.	We shall be able to exchange Ugx ->cryptos at the Blockchain House, besides we are partnering with some money exchangers in different cities to do the same.
5.	In this case, remittance will be available and providing a solution to business people, in that a person in a different city can send crypto to another person in another city since we shall have partners/exchangers to liquidate their Cryptos to Uganda shillings hence cheap transaction fees.
We shall have remittance solution in partnership with money changers in different cities.
They keep some money some money both in cryptos and Ugx shillings, When someone wants to send or receive money, these money changers will send equivalent of the paid in crypto to its destination in Ugx
Partners will for example exchange cryptos for Ugx for tourists and other people who receive cryptos as a remittance and want to cash it out.
